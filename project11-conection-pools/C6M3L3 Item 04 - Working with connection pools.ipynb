    "To complete this lab, you need to install Python and MySQL. Then you need to install MySQL Connector/Python client or API on your Python environment. Follow the instructions in previous videos to install the required packages or software.  \n",

    "## Scenario: \n",
    "\n",
    "Little Lemon’s guests need to access the database for any booking or inquiry, for example, reading the menu. Little Lemon, therefore, needs to establish a connection between the Python and MySQL databases for every operation.  Establishing a connection every time is resource intensive and it is affecting the performance of the Little Lemon application. To improve the performance of the application, Little Lemon needs to establish a pool of database connections to facilitate the guests’ inquiries to the database. \n",
